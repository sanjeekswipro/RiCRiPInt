 *    Grid fitting is performed in-place (i.e., the computed results are written to the
 *    x, y, cx, and cy coordinates of each pen command in the penCmds array, thereby

 *    accommodate the validation of MAZ alignment zones for outline-based glyphs. To
 *    better understand these data structures and functions and the role they play in

 *    Point representation for an outline-based glyph
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    A MAZOutlinePoint represents a single two-dimensional (x, y) point of an
 *    outline-based glyph. It can represent either an "on-curve" point (i.e., a point
 *    that lies on the outline) or an "off-curve" point (i.e., a point that may or may
 *    not lie on the outline, such as the control point for a quadratic Bezier curve
 *    segment). The elements of a MAZOutlinePoint are:
 *
 *    ox, oy: The original real-valued image coordinates of the point.
 *
 *    hx, hy: The hinted real-valued image coordinates of the point.
 *
 *    flags: A set of bit flags that determine special properties of the point (see
 *    Point Flags section below).
 *
 *    prev: A pointer to the previous point in this point's contour. The points in a
 *    contour form a circular linked list; prev is a pointer to the previous element in
 *    this linked list.
 *
 *    next: A pointer to the next point in this point's contour. The points in a
 *    contour form a circular linked list; next is a pointer to the next element in
 *    this linked list.
 *
 *    contour: A pointer to the contour to which this point belongs.

 *    Contour representation for an outline-based glyph
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    A MAZOutlineContour represents a sequence of points that define a closed path in
 *    an outline-based glyph. The MAZOutlineContour data structure is divided into two
 *    parts. The first part applies to all contours of a glyph (i.e., both root
 *    contours and internal contours), while the second part applies only to root
 *    contours and the radicals they represent. See the Algorithm Overview section in
 *    ADFAlgnZonesMAZOutlines.c for the definitions of root contours, internal
 *    contours, and radicals.
 *
 *    Radicals are represented implicitly by the MAZOutlineContour data structure. The
 *    elements in the second part of the data structure describe the segments and
 *    segment pairs contained in the radical.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    The following elements apply to all contours:
 *
 *    xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax: The real-valued image coordinates of this contour's
 *    bounding box before grid fitting is applied.
 *
 *    bboxArea: The area (in real-valued image coordinates) of this contour's bounding
 *    box before grid fitting is applied.
 *
 *    points: A pointer to the first point in this contour.
 *
 *    radical: A pointer to the root contour that contains this contour. If this
 *    contour is itself the root contour, then this element points to itself (i.e., if
 *    C is a pointer to a root contour, then C->radical == C).
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    The following elements apply only to root contours and the radicals they
 *    represent (they are undefined for other contours):
 *
 *    hSeg: A pointer to the first horizontal simple segment in this root contour's
 *    radical. All horizontal simple segments in this radical form a linked list and
 *    hSeg is a pointer to the first element of this linked list.
 *
 *    vSeg: A pointer to the first vertical simple segment in this root contour's
 *    radical. All vertical simple segments in this radical form a linked list and vSeg
 *    is a pointer to the first element of this linked list.
 *
 *    hMergeSeg: A pointer to the first horizontal simple segment comprising the first
 *    horizontal merged segment in this root contour's radical. All horizontal merged
 *    segments in this radical form a linked list and hMergeSeg is a pointer to the
 *    first element of this linked list.
 *
 *    vMergeSeg: A pointer to the first vertical simple segment comprising the first
 *    vertical merged segment in this root contour's radical. All vertical merged
 *    segments in this radical form a linked list and vMergeSeg is a pointer to the
 *    first element of this linked list.

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Simple segments are represented explicitly by the MAZOutlineSegment data
 *    structure. Merged segments and paired segments are represented implicitly (via
 *    pointers and linked lists) by the MAZOutlineSegment data structure. See the
 *    Algorithm Overview section in ADFAlgnZonesMAZOutlines.c for the definitions of
 *    simple segments, merged segments, and paired segments.
 *
 *    Terminology: The documentation below uses the identifier "S" to refer to a simple
 *    segment and the identifier "M" to refer to the merged segment that contains S. A
 *    simple segment S is the "head" of a merged segment M if S is the first element in
 *    the linked list of simple segments that comprise M.
 *
 *    The elements of a MAZOutlineSegment are:
 *
 *    increasing: The Boolean value that is set to true if (1) S is horizontal and is
 *    oriented from left to right or (2) S is vertical and is oriented from bottom to
 *    top. increasing is set to false otherwise.
 *
 *    isMerged: The Boolean value that is set to false during the initialization of S
 *    but later set to true when S is added to a merged segment.
 *
 *    minLocal, maxLocal: If S is horizontal, minLocal and maxLocal are the minimum and
 *    maximum original x coordinates of S, respectively. If S is vertical, minLocal and
 *    maxLocal are the minimum and maximum original y coordinates of S, respectively.
 *    In summary, minLocal and maxLocal are the minimum and maximum original
 *    coordinates of S parallel to the direction of S. minLocal and maxLocal are
 *    represented in real-valued image coordinates.
 *
 *    minMerged, maxMerged: Every simple segment S is contained in a merged segment M.
 *    If S is not the head of M, then minMerged and maxMerged are ignored and
 *    undefined. If S is horizontal and is the head of M, minMerged and maxMerged are
 *    the minimum and maximum original x coordinates across all simple segments in M,
 *    respectively. If S is vertical and is the head of M, minMerged and maxMerged are
 *    the minimum and maximum original y coordinates across all simple segments in M,
 *    respectively. In summary, minMerged and maxMerged are the minimum and maximum
 *    original coordinates of M parallel to the direction of M. minMerged and maxMerged
 *    are represented in real-valued image coordinates.
 *
 *    minPerpLocal, maxPerpLocal: If S is horizontal, minPerpLocal and maxPerpLocal are
 *    the minimum and maximum original y coordinates of S, respectively. If S is
 *    vertical, minPerpLocal and maxPerpLocal are the minimum and maximum original x
 *    coordinates of S, respectively. In summary, minPerpLocal and maxPerpLocal are the
 *    minimum and maximum original coordinates of S perpendicular to the direction of
 *    S. minPerpLocal and maxPerpLocal are represented in real-valued image
 *    coordinates.
 *
 *    minPerpMerged, maxPerpMerged: Every simple segment S is contained in a merged
 *    segment M. If S is not the head of M, then minPerpMerged and maxPerpMerged are
 *    ignored and undefined. If S is horizontal and is the head of M, minPerpMerged and
 *    maxPerpMerged are the minimum and maximum original y coordinates across all
 *    simple segments in M, respectively. If S is vertical and is the head of M,
 *    minPerpMerged and maxPerpMerged are the minimum and maximum original x
 *    coordinates across all simple segments in M, respectively. In summary,
 *    minPerpMerged and maxPerpMerged are the minimum and maximum original coordinates
 *    of M perpendicular to the direction of M. minPerpMerged and maxPerpMerged are
 *    represented in real-valued image coordinates.
 *
 *    p1: A pointer to the first point in S. Note that p1 immediately precedes p2 (see
 *    below) in the ordered sequence of pen commands that describe the input glyph.
 *
 *    p2: A pointer to the second point in S. Note that p2 immediately follows p1 (see
 *    above) in the ordered sequence of pen commands that describe the input glyph.
 *
 *    next: If S is horizontal, next is a pointer to the next horizontal simple segment
 *    in S's radical. If S is vertical, next is a pointer to the next vertical simple
 *    segment in S's radical. A NULL value indicates that S is the last element in the
 *    linked list of simple segments.
 *
 *    mergeChain: A merged segment is represented implicitly by a linked list of simple
 *    segments; mergeChain is the pointer used to implement this linked list. There is
 *    no significance to the ordering of simple segments within the linked list. If S
 *    is horizontal and is contained in a merged segment M, mergeChain points to the
 *    next horizontal simple segment in M (or is set to NULL if S is the last element
 *    of the linked list). Similarly, if S is vertical and is contained in a merged
 *    segment M, mergeChain points to the next vertical simple segment in M (or is set
 *    to NULL if S is the last element of the linked list). Note that a merged segment
 *    may contain only one simple segment.
 *
 *    nextMerge: Merged segments within a radical are connected to each other by a
 *    linked list; nextMerge is the pointer used to implement this linked list. There
 *    is no significance to the ordering of merged segments within the linked list. If
 *    S is not the head of a merged segment, then nextMerge is ignored and undefined.
 *    If S is horizontal, is the head of a merged segment M, and is contained in
 *    radical R, nextMerge points to the first horizontal simple segment in the next
 *    horizontal merged segment in radical R (or is set to NULL if M is the last
 *    element of the linked list). Similarly, if S is vertical, is the head of a merged
 *    segment M, and is contained in radical R, nextMerge points to the first vertical
 *    simple segment in the next vertical merged segment in radical R (or is set to
 *    NULL if M is the last element of the linked list).
 *
 *    pairMax: If S is not the head of a merged segment M, then pairMax is ignored and
 *    undefined. If S is the head of a merged segment M and M is the minimum paired
 *    segment of a segment pair, then pairMax points to the maximum paired segment in
 *    the segment pair (and pairMin (see below) will be set to NULL). Otherwise,
 *    pairMax is set to NULL.
 *
 *    pairMin: If S is not the head of a merged segment M, then pairMin is ignored and
 *    undefined. If S is the head of a merged segment M and M is the maximum paired
 *    segment of a segment pair, then pairMin points to the minimum paired segment in
 *    the segment pair (and pairMax (see above) will be set to NULL). Otherwise,
 *    pairMin is set to NULL.

 *    Segment pair representation for an outline-based glyph
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    A MAZOutlineSegPair represents either a horizontal segment pair or a vertical
 *    segment pair. The documentation below uses the identifier P to refer to a segment
 *    pair variable. Let P = {S1,S2}, where S1 is the minimum paired segment of P and
 *    S2 is the maximum paired segment of P. The concepts of segment pairs, minimum
 *    paired segments, maximum paired segments, child segment pairs, segment pair
 *    trees, rounding up, and rounding down are described in the Algorithm Overview
 *    section in ADFAlgnZonesMAZOutlines.c.
 *
 *    The elements of a MAZOutlineSegPair are:
 *
 *    width: P's original pair width.
 *
 *    cOrig: If P is a horizontal segment pair, cOrig is the original coordinate of P
 *    (i.e., the original middle y coordinate of S1). If P is a vertical segment pair,
 *    cOrig is the original coordinate of P (i.e., the original middle x coordinate of
 *    S1).
 *
 *    cMin, cMax: If P is a horizontal segment pair, cMin and cMax are the minimum and
 *    maximum original x coordinates over all points in S1 and S2, respectively. If P
 *    is a vertical segment pair, cMin and cMax are the minimum and maximum original y
 *    coordinates over all points in S1 and S2, respectively.
 *
 *    cHint: If P is a horizontal segment pair, cHint is the hinted y coordinate of S1.
 *    If P is a vertical segment pair, cHint is the hinted x coordinate of S1.
 *
 *    cHintLow: The maximum integer not greater than (cOrig - 0.5) (i.e., cHintLow is
 *    the "floor" of (cOrig - 0.5)). Example #1: if cOrig is 7.4, then cHintLow is 6.
 *    Example #2: if cOrig is 9.5, then cHintLow is 9.
 *
 *    canRoundDownSolo: A Boolean set to true if P can be rounded down (i.e., aligned
 *    to cHintLow) without colliding with any of its children in their current state.
 *
 *    canRoundDownTree: A Boolean set to true if the segment pair tree with root P can
 *    be rounded down without creating any collisions whatsoever in the segment pair
 *    tree.
 *
 *    seg: A pointer to the MAZOutlineSegment data structure that represents S1.
 *
 *    link: A temporary pointer used for linked list traversals of segment pairs.
 *
 *    children: A fixed length array of pointers to child segment pairs.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    MAZ_OUTLINE_MAX_CHILDREN is the maximum number of children a MAZOutlineSegPair
 *    can have. Experiments on thousands of outline-based glyphs from different
 *    typefaces show that segment pairs have 1 child on average and at most 3 children.
 *    Segment pairs with 4 or more children are extremely rare and occur only in highly
 *    complex glyphs. Collisions may not be resolved between P and all of its children
 *    if P has more than MAZ_OUTLINE_MAX_CHILDREN children.

 *    MAZ DATA STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS FOR UNIFORM-WIDTH STROKE-BASED GLYPHS
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    The following data structures and functions are placed in this header file to
 *    accommodate the validation of MAZ alignment zones for uniform-width stroke-based
 *    glyphs. To better understand these data structures and functions and their role
 *    in performing grid fitting on uniform-width stroke-based glyphs, refer to the
 *    Algorithm Overview section in ADFAlgnZonesMAZStrokes.c. The Algorithm Overview
 *    section also explains the terminology used below.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Stroke-based segment representation for a uniform-width stroke-based glyph
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    A MAZStrokeSegment represents either a horizontal segment or a vertical segment.
 *    The documentation below uses the identifier S to refer to a segment variable. The
 *    concepts of segments, child segments, segment trees, rounding up, and rounding
 *    down are described in the Algorithm Overview section in ADFAlgnZonesMAZStrokes.c.
 *
 *    The elements of a MAZStrokeSegment are:
 *
 *    cOrig: If S is horizontal, cOrig is the original y coordinate of S. If S is
 *    vertical, cOrig is the original x coordinate of S.
 *
 *    cMin, cMax: If S is horizontal, cMin and cMax are the minimum and maximum
 *    original x coordinates of S, respectively. If S is vertical, cMin and cMax are
 *    the minimum and maximum original y coordinates of S, respectively.
 *
 *    cHint: If S is horizontal, cHint is the hinted y coordinate of S (i.e., the
 *    integer y coordinate to which S is aligned). If S is vertical, cHint is the
 *    hinted x coordinate of S (i.e., the integer x coordinate to which S is aligned).
 *
 *    cHintLow: The maximum integer not greater than cOrig (i.e., cHintLow is the
 *    "floor" of cOrig). Example #1: if cOrig is 7.6, then cHintLow is 7. Example #2:
 *    if cOrig is 9.0, then cHintLow is 9.
 *
 *    canRoundDownSolo: A Boolean set to true if S can be rounded down (i.e., aligned
 *    to cHintLow) without colliding with any of its children in their current state.
 *
 *    canRoundDownTree: A Boolean set to true if the segment tree with root S can be
 *    rounded down without creating any collisions whatsoever in the segment tree.
 *
 *    isCollapsed: A Boolean set to true if S has been aligned to one of its child
 *    segments during collision resolution via merging. This occurs when S collides
 *    when one of its children and the collision cannot be resolved via rounding.
 *
 *    link: A temporary pointer used for linked list traversals of segments.
 *
 *    children: A fixed length array of pointers to child segments.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    MAZ_STROKE_MAX_CHILDREN is the maximum number of children a MAZStrokeSegment can
 *    have. Experiments on thousands of uniform-width stroke-based glyphs from
 *    different typefaces show that segments have 1 child on average and at most 3
 *    children. Segments with 4 or more children are extremely rare and occur only in
 *    highly complex glyphs. Collisions may not be resolved between S and all of its
 *    children if S has more than MAZ_STROKE_MAX_CHILDREN children.
