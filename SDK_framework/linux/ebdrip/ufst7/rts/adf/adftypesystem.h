 *    OVERVIEW
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Description:
 *
 *    This file defines the application programming interface (API) for the Adaptively
 *    Sampled Distance Field (ADF) type rendering system (a.k.a. Saffron). Saffron is a
 *    cross-platform (i.e., OS- and processor-independent) engine that provides
 *    efficient, high quality, scalable type rendering with automatic hinting.
 *
 *    For an introduction to ADFs, see U.S. Patent 6,396,492 "Detail-Directed 
 *    Hierarchical Distance Fields", Sarah Frisken, Ronald Perry, and Thouis Jones
 *    and "Adaptively Sampled Distance Fields: A General Representation of Shape for 
 *    Computer Graphics", SIGGRAPH 2000 Conference Proceedings, Sarah Frisken, Ronald 
 *    Perry, Alyn Rockwood, and Thouis Jones. A brief overview follows.
 *    
 *    We define a 2-dimensional signed distance field D representing a closed
 *    2-dimensional shape S (such as a glyph) as a mapping D:RxR-->R for all points p
 *    contained in RxR such that D(p) = sign(p) * min{||p - q||: for all points q on
 *    the zero-valued iso-surface (i.e., edge) of S}, sign(p) = {-1 if p is outside S,
 *    +1 if p is inside S}, and ||.|| is the Euclidean norm. Less formally, the
 *    distance field of a glyph simply measures the minimum distance from any point p
 *    in space to the edge of the glyph, where the sign of this distance is negative if
 *    p is outside the glyph and positive if p is inside the glyph. ADFs are generated
 *    by performing a detail-directed sampling of the shape’s distance field wherein
 *    the sampled values (such as distances and reconstruction data) are stored in a
 *    data structure for efficient processing. Distances at arbitrary points in the
 *    field can then be reconstructed from the sampled values and used for processing
 *    such as rendering and editing. The use of adaptive detail-directed sampling
 *    permits higher sampling rates in regions of fine detail and lower sampling rates
 *    where the distance field varies smoothly, thereby allowing very high accuracy
 *    with minimal memory requirements. ADFs, like TrueType outlines, can be rendered
 *    at any size and orientation.
 *
 *    ADF glyphs are rendered using a new distance-based antialiasing algorithm (see,
 *    for example, U.S. Patent 7,034,845 "Method for Antialiasing an Object Represented
 *    as a Two-Dimensional Distance Field in Image-Order" by Ronald Perry and Sarah
 *    Frisken, U.S. Patent 6,982,724 "Method for Antialiasing an Object Represented as
 *    a Two-Dimensional Distance Field in Object-Order" by Sarah Frisken and Ronald
 *    Perry, and U.S. Patent 6,917,369 "Method and Apparatus for Rendering Cell-Based
 *    Distance Fields Using Texture Mapping" by Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken). Rather
 *    than computing a coverage value at each sample point, we reconstruct the distance
 *    at each sample point and then map the distance to a density value. Coverage-based
 *    approaches require either a complex and expensive analytic filter or many
 *    supersamples to approximate the coverage value at each sample point. ADF
 *    rendering requires just a single distance reconstruction per sample and provides
 *    quality comparable to exact analytic methods.
 *
 *    During ADF rendering, strong vertical and horizontal edges of glyphs and
 *    characteristic distances (e.g., cap heights) of the typeface can be aligned to
 *    the pixel grid to provide better contrast, uniform stroke weights, and consistent
 *    characteristic distances. This process, referred to as 'grid fitting' in this
 *    API, uses a set of 'alignment zones' that we detect automatically from each ADF.
 *    Basic Alignment Zones (BAZ)are optimized for non-CJK glyphs. 
 *    Multiple Alignment Zones (MAZ)are optimized for CJK glyphs. Both are detected 
 *    dynamically during hinting. Saffron also supports the rendering of application-hinted 
 *    glyphs.
 *
 *    Glyphs are imported into Saffron as ADFPaths. ADFPaths can represent both
 *    outline-based glyphs (e.g., from TrueType fonts) comprising a set of closed
 *    contours and stroke-based glyphs comprising 1) a set of stroke skeletons that can
 *    be either open or closed and 2) stroke data such as stroke width and stroke
 *    endcaps.
 *
 *    This API is structured as a toolkit, and includes the following major functional
 *    blocks:
 *    
 *        1) Conversion of ADFPaths to ADFs 
 *        2) Rendering ADFs as density images
 *        3) Determining alignment zones directly from ADFs, thereby enabling grid 
 *           fitting during ADF rendering
 *        4) A dual caching system for ADFs and density images
 *
 *    Saffron supports two types of ADFs for representing glyphs: explicit ADFs and 
 *    implicit ADFs. A compile time Boolean flag (ADF_USE_IMPLICIT_ADFS) controls the 
 *    selection of which ADF type to use throughout the system. The usage note Explicit
 *    and Implicit ADFs (see below) describes both ADF types and provides guidance for 
 *    selecting which ADF type best suits the needs of the application. 
 *
 *    Saffron supports both CRT and LCD (i.e., sub-pixel) rendering. During sub-pixel
 *    rendering, each color component is treated as a separate sample; these samples
 *    are then combined to determine all the color components for the pixel. Sub-pixel 
 *    rendering increases the effective resolution of the display, thus enabling higher
 *    quality type on displays with addressable components (e.g., LCDs).
 *
 *    Throughout this document we will refer to traditional pixel-based rendering as
 *    CRT rendering (i.e., CRT mode) and sub-pixel rendering as LCD rendering (i.e., 
 *    LCD mode). Saffron can apply sub-pixel rendering not only to LCD displays, but 
 *    to any type of display with addressable sub-pixels such as organic LEDs. The 
 *    list of supported LCD modes (e.g., ADF_REND_MODE_RGBv) is described in the 
 *    rendering section of this API. Note that LCD rendering can be used on CRT 
 *    displays even though the pixel components are not individually addressable: 
 *    the additional distance field samples result in a cleaner edge which many users
 *    prefer.

/**
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTES
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT ADFS
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Saffron supports two types of ADFs for representing glyphs: explicit ADFs and
 *    implicit ADFs. A compile time Boolean flag (ADF_USE_IMPLICIT_ADFS) controls the
 *    selection of which ADF type to use throughout the system. iType only uses 
 *    IMPLICIT ADFs.
 *
 *    Explicit ADF generation uses top-down spatial subdivision to generate a spatial 
 *    hierarchy of explicit ADF cells, where each explicit ADF cell contains a set of 
 *    sampled distance values and a reconstruction method; explicit ADF rendering 
 *    reconstructs the distance field within each explicit ADF cell using its 
 *    reconstruction method and then maps the reconstructed distances to density 
 *    values.
 *
 *    In contrast, implicit ADF cells are not generated during generation (they are 
 *    generated on-demand during rendering). More specifically, implicit ADF generation
 *    preprocesses an ADFPath (which represents a glyph); implicit ADF rendering 
 *    generates implicit ADF cells from the preprocessed ADFPath and renders each 
 *    implicit ADF cell by 1) reconstructing the distance field within the implicit ADF
 *    cell using its reconstruction method and 2) mapping the reconstructed distances 
 *    to density values.
 *
 *    The following should be considered when selecting which ADF type to use:
 *
 *    1) Implicit ADFs support stroke-based glyphs; explicit ADFs do not.
 *
 *    2) Implicit ADFs support MAZ alignment zones; explicit ADFs do not.
 *
 *    3) Implicit ADFs can be processed internally using either floating point
 *       arithmetic or fixed point arithmetic (see the Math Mode Selection section
 *       below); explicit ADFs are always processed internally using floating point
 *       arithmetic.
 *
 *    4) Implicit ADF generation is nearly instantaneous while explicit ADF generation 
 *       is in the range of 2000 explicit ADF glyphs per second (assuming level 4 
 *       explicit ADFs (see below) and a Pentium M 2.0 GHz CPU).
 *
 *    5) While both ADF types provide fast interactive rendering, implicit ADF
 *       rendering is, in general, faster than explicit ADF rendering for large point
 *       sizes. The crossover point in performance (i.e., the point size at which the
 *       implicit ADF rendering speed and the explicit ADF rendering speed are roughly
 *       equal) depends on both the current library implementation and system
 *       characteristics such as CPU cache sizes. For optimal performance, applications
 *       should be benchmarked and profiled to determine the appropriate ADF type.
 *
 *    6) Implicit ADFs always provide high quality rendering while the rendering 
 *       quality of explicit ADFs depends on the generation attributes (see 
 *       ADFGenAttrs) set by the application. In general, higher quality explicit ADFs
 *       are larger and require longer generation times than lower quality explicit 
 *       ADFs.
 *
 *    7) In general, implicit ADFs are smaller than explicit ADFs. Implicit ADFs are 
 *       approximately the same size as their ADFPaths (in the range of 350 bytes to 
 *       1K bytes) while typical sizes for explicit ADFs of Latin glyphs range from 
 *       2K bytes (for level 4 explicit ADFs, which provide high quality rendering for 
 *       20 ppem and below) to 4K bytes (for level 7 explicit ADFs, which provide high 
 *       quality rendering for all ppems).

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: BASIC DATA FLOW AND PROCESSING STEPS
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    To illustrate the basic data flow and processing steps when using Saffron, a
 *    simple example for rendering with grid fitting is outlined here:
 *    
 *    1) Initialize the system
 *
 *    2) Typeset and render each glyph
 *
 *    3) Terminate the system
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: COMPOSITING GLYPH DENSITY IMAGES
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    The Saffron type system renders a glyph (represented as an ADF) according to 
 *    a set of rendering parameters to produce a density image. A density image 
 *    records a 'density' value for each component of each pixel which can be treated 
 *    as an alpha value. Density images can be used by the application to blend a 
 *    foreground color (e.g., a text color) with a background color or a background 
 *    image to produce a colored image of the rendered glyph. This colored image can 
 *    then be BLTed to the display. Note that rendered density images can be used
 *    directly for blending white text on a background or inverted (i.e., 255 - 
 *    density) to blend black text on a background.
 *
 *    The blending, or 'compositing', can be performed in software using the density
 *    value for each pixel (in CRT mode) or pixel component (in LCD mode) to blend 
 *    the corresponding background and foreground pixels or pixel components. Some 
 *    examples of how the color of a destination pixel can be determined from the 
 *    corresponding density image pixel, the foreground color, and the background 
 *    color (or background image pixel) are provided here.
 *        
 *    When rendering in CRT mode, the density image has one component per pixel:
 *    A_density. When rendering in LCD mode (i.e., sub-pixel rendering), the density
 *    image has four components per pixel: R_density, G_density, B_density, and
 *    A_density, where A_density is set to the maximum of R_density, G_density, and
 *    B_density. The foreground color is denoted 'fg' and the background color is
 *    denoted 'bg'. All color and density values range from 0 to 255.
 *
 *
 *    ALPHA BLEND:
 *
 *    Alpha blending uses the density value of each pixel or each pixel component
 *    to blend the foreground and background pixel colors to determine the 
 *    destination pixel color (R, G, B, A). Note that alpha blending can be avoided 
 *    for each pixel if the pixel's A_density is zero.
 *
 *    For CRT mode:
 *        R <-- R_bg + (R_fg - R_bg) * A_density / 255
 *        G <-- G_bg + (G_fg - G_bg) * A_density / 255
 *        B <-- B_bg + (B_fg - B_bg) * A_density / 255
 *        A <-- A_bg + (A_fg - A_bg) * A_density / 255
 *
 *    For LCD mode:
 *        R <-- R_bg + (R_fg - R_bg) * R_density / 255
 *        G <-- G_bg + (G_fg - G_bg) * G_density / 255
 *        B <-- B_bg + (B_fg - B_bg) * B_density / 255
 *        A <-- A_bg + (A_fg - A_bg) * A_density / 255
 *
 *    
 *    ALPHA TEST:
 *
 *    For white text on a black background or black text on a white background,
 *    alpha blending can be replaced by a simple alpha test or a simple alpha
 *    test with an inversion as shown here.
 *
 *    White text on a black background
 *        For CRT mode: 
 *            if (A_density > 0) {
 *                R <-- A_density
 *                G <-- A_density
 *                B <-- A_density
 *                A <-- A_density
 *            }
 * 
 *        For LCD mode: 
 *            if (A_density > 0) {
 *                R <-- R_density
 *                G <-- G_density
 *                B <-- B_density
 *                A <-- A_density
 *            }
 *
 *    Black text on a white background
 *        For CRT mode: 
 *            if (A_density > 0) {
 *                R <-- 255 - A_density
 *                G <-- 255 - A_density
 *                B <-- 255 - A_density
 *                A <-- A_density
 *            }
 *    
 *        For LCD mode: 
 *            if (A_density > 0) {
 *                R <-- 255 - R_density
 *                G <-- 255 - G_density
 *                B <-- 255 - B_density
 *                A <-- A_density
 *            }
 *
 *
 *    MINMAX BLEND:
 *
 *    For white text on a black background, minmax blending determines the destination
 *    pixel color (R, G, B, A) by computing the maximum of the density value of each
 *    pixel or pixel component and the background pixel color. For black text on a
 *    white background, minmax blending determines the destination pixel color (R, G,
 *    B, A) by computing the minimum of the inverted density value of each pixel or
 *    pixel component and the background pixel color.
 *
 *    White text on a black background
 *        For CRT mode: 
 *            R <-- maximum(R_bg, A_density)
 *            G <-- maximum(G_bg, A_density)
 *            B <-- maximum(B_bg, A_density)
 *            A <-- maximum(A_bg, A_density)
 * 
 *        For LCD mode: 
 *            R <-- maximum(R_bg, R_density)
 *            G <-- maximum(G_bg, G_density)
 *            B <-- maximum(B_bg, B_density)
 *            A <-- maximum(A_bg, A_density)
 *
 *    Black text on a white background
 *        For CRT mode: 
 *            R <-- minimum(R_bg, 255 - A_density)
 *            G <-- minimum(G_bg, 255 - A_density)
 *            B <-- minimum(B_bg, 255 - A_density)
 *            A <-- minimum(A_bg, A_density)
 * 
 *        For LCD mode: 
 *            R <-- minimum(R_bg, 255 - R_density)
 *            G <-- minimum(G_bg, 255 - G_density)
 *            B <-- minimum(B_bg, 255 - B_density)
 *            A <-- minimum(A_bg, A_density)
 *
 *
 *    INVERSE MULTIPLY:
 *
 *    Black text can also be composited by first inverting the density image and
 *    then multiplying the background color by the inverted density. The result of
 *    the multiply is then normalized to [0, 255]. This compositing method uses the 
 *    glyph density image to darken the underlying background image. Note that the 
 *    inverse multiply can be avoided for each pixel if the pixel's A_density is 
 *    zero.
 *    
 *    For CRT mode:
 *        R <-- R_bg * (255 - A_density) / 255
 *        G <-- G_bg * (255 - A_density) / 255
 *        B <-- B_bg * (255 - A_density) / 255
 *        A <-- A_bg * A_density / 255
 *
 *    For LCD mode:
 *        R <-- R_bg * (255 - R_density) / 255
 *        G <-- G_bg * (255 - G_density) / 255
 *        B <-- B_bg * (255 - B_density) / 255
 *        A <-- A_bg * A_density / 255
 *
 *
 *    SPECIAL EFFECTS:
 *
 *    Density images can be used in a variety of blending methods. For example, density 
 *    images make effective masks when a direct MULTIPLY, rather than an INVERSE
 *    MULTIPLY, is used for blending.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: COMBINING GLYPH DENSITY IMAGES
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    When glyph density images overlap, they can either be composited sequentially 
 *    onto the background image (as described above), or they can be combined first in 
 *    a 'combining buffer' and then the combining buffer can be composited onto the 
 *    background image in a single pass. There are various ways for combining 
 *    overlapping density values in the combining buffer. For example, density values
 *    can be combined using a CSG union operation, which selects the maximum density 
 *    value for each pixel (CRT mode) or pixel component (LCD mode). In addition, 
 *    various other methods can be used as described below.
 *
 *    Density values in the combining buffer are initialized to zero. Then, for each 
 *    pixel of a density image being combined, the corresponding pixel of the 
 *    combining buffer is set according to one of the following methods.
 *
 *
 *    MAXIMUM DENSITY:
 *
 *    This method selects the maximum density value for each pixel or pixel component
 *    and corresponds to a CSG union operation.
 *
 *    For CRT mode:
 *        A_combined <-- maximum(A_combined, A_density)
 *
 *    For LCD mode:
 *        R_combined <-- maximum(R_combined, R_density)
 *        G_combined <-- maximum(G_combined, G_density)
 *        B_combined <-- maximum(B_combined, B_density)
 *        A_combined <-- maximum(R_combined, G_combined, B_combined)
 *    
 *
 *    AVERAGE DENSITY:
 *
 *    This method can provide better antialiasing when rendered glyphs overlap and 
 *    can reduce color fringing in LCD mode.
 *
 *    For CRT mode:
 *        A_combined <-- average(A_combined, A_density)
 *
 *    For LCD mode:
 *        R_combined <-- average(R_combined, R_density)
 *        G_combined <-- average(G_combined, G_density)
 *        B_combined <-- average(B_combined, B_density)
 *        A_combined <-- maximum(R_combined, G_combined, B_combined)
 *
 *
 *    INVERSE MULTIPLY:
 *
 *    This method is a generalization of inverse multiply for compositing (as
 *    described above); it can be used to perform a darkening blend of density
 *    images. Like average density, it can provide better antialiasing when rendered
 *    glyphs overlap and can reduce color fringing in LCD mode.
 *
 *    For CRT mode:
 *        A_combined <-- 255 - (255 - A_combined) * (255 - A_density) / 255
 *
 *    For LCD mode:
 *        R_combined <-- 255 - (255 - R_combined) * (255 - R_density) / 255
 *        G_combined <-- 255 - (255 - G_combined) * (255 - G_density) / 255
 *        B_combined <-- 255 - (255 - B_combined) * (255 - B_density) / 255
 *        A_combined <-- maximum(R_combined, G_combined, B_combined)
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: COORDINATE SYSTEMS
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    All coordinate systems within this library are Cartesian: the x-axis increases 
 *    from left to right, and the y-axis increases from bottom to top. The major 
 *    coordinate systems are enumerated here.
 *
 *
 *    ADF COORDINATES:
 *    
 *    ADFs are represented in a 2-dimensional floating point coordinate system defined 
 *    over [0.0, 1.0] x [0.0, 1.0]. Distance values in an ADF are measured in this 
 *    coordinate system.
 *
 *
 *    FONT UNITS:
 *
 *    Glyphs are represented by the ADFPath data structure. Points that define a glyph
 *    are located on a grid whose size is defined by the creator of the font. The units
 *    of this grid are conventionally referred to as font units.
 *
 *    When creating the glyph, the font creator makes use of an imaginary square that 
 *    is derived from the old typographic concept of the em square. This square can be 
 *    thought of as a tablet on which the characters are drawn, although it is 
 *    permissible for characters to extend beyond the tablet or em square. 
 *
 *    In order to scale glyphs to a specified point size, this API requires the number
 *    of font units per em square (e.g., 2048 in the core Apple and Microsoft TTF
 *    fonts). To support both integer-based (e.g., TTF) and floating point-based (e.g.,
 *    Type 1) font representations, this library uses floating point font units. It is
 *    assumed that the glyph origin (i.e., the reference point for typesetting) lies at
 *    (0,0) in font units.
 *
 *
 *    INTEGER PIXEL COORDINATES:
 *
 *    The image origin of a density image, which is used for positioning the image
 *    during compositing, is represented in integer pixel coordinates. The image 
 *    origin is the bottom-left corner of the image.
 *
 *
 *    FLOATING POINT PIXEL COORDINATES:
 *
 *    Glyph pen positions for typesetting (i.e., the locations of the glyph origins) 
 *    are specified in floating point pixel coordinates. When grid fitting, glyph pen
 *    position adjustments are measured in floating point pixel coordinates; glyph 
 *    scale adjustments scale from font units to floating point pixel coordinates. 
 *    These grid fitting adjustments can be used by the application when typesetting.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: CONTINUOUS STROKE MODULATION
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    The Saffron type system exploits the inherent properties of distance fields to 
 *    provide 'Continuous Stroke Modulation' (CSM), i.e., continuous modulation of
 *    both stroke weight and edge sharpness. CSM uses three rendering parameters to 
 *    control the mapping of ADF distances to glyph density values. Optimal values 
 *    for these parameters are highly subjective; they can depend on user preferences, 
 *    lighting conditions, display properties, typeface, foreground and background 
 *    colors, and point size. Ideally, an application would provide support for users
 *    to tune CSM parameters according to personal preferences. However, under most 
 *    circumstances, high quality type can be achieved with a small set of default 
 *    parameters that can be preset by the application.
 *
 *    The function that maps ADF distances to density values has an outside cutoff
 *    value, below which densities are set to zero, and an inside cutoff value, above
 *    which densities are set to a maximum density value (e.g., 255). Between these two
 *    cutoff values, the mapping function is a gamma curve ranging from zero at the
 *    outside cutoff value to the maximum density at the inside cutoff value. The shape
 *    of the curve is governed by a gamma exponent; when the exponent is 1.0, the curve
 *    is linear.
 *
 *    Adjusting the outside and inside cutoff values affects stroke weight and edge
 *    sharpness. The spacing between these two parameters is comparable to twice the
 *    filter radius of classic antialiasing methods; a narrow spacing provides a
 *    sharper edge while a wider spacing provides a softer, more filtered edge. When
 *    the spacing is zero, the resulting density image is a bi-level bitmap. When the
 *    spacing is very wide, the resulting density image has a watercolor-like edge.
 *    Typically, users prefer sharp, high contrast edges at small point sizes and
 *    softer edges for larger point sizes and for animated text. Hence, to achieve
 *    optimal quality, the default CSM parameters preset by the application should be
 *    point size dependent. Note that outside and inside cutoff values are specified in
 *    floating point pixel coordinates.
 *    
 *    Because a glyph's edge lies at the zero-valued iso-surface of its corresponding
 *    ADF, the outside cutoff value typically has a negative value, the inside cutoff
 *    value typically has a positive value, and their midpoint typically lies near
 *    zero. Adjusting these parameters to shift the midpoint towards negative infinity
 *    will increase the stroke weight; shifting the midpoint towards positive infinity
 *    will decrease the stroke weight. Note that the outside cutoff value should always
 *    be less than or equal to the inside cutoff value.
 *
 *    Under most circumstances, a linear mapping from distance to density (i.e., a
 *    gamma exponent equal to 1.0) is recommended. The gamma exponent can be used to
 *    compensate for the non-linear characteristics of CRT and LCD displays.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: COLOR REDUCTION
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    As noted above, Saffron supports sub-pixel rendering for LCD displays. Sub-pixel
 *    rendering increases the effective resolution of the display, but it can also lead
 *    to undesirable 'color fringing' artifacts. These artifacts appear because the
 *    individual sub-pixel components are set to different values. Color fringing tends
 *    to be more noticeable at smaller point sizes and when using typefaces with thin
 *    strokes, such as Monotype's Courier New (Version 2.90).
 *
 *    To combat this problem, Saffron provides a color reduction feature that analyzes
 *    the amount of color present in the rendered pixels and reduces the color if
 *    necessary. This feature is user-controllable via two attributes in the
 *    ADFRenderAttrs data structure: useColorReduction and colorReductionAmt.
 *
 *    The useColorReduction attribute is a Boolean flag that turns the color reduction
 *    feature on or off; setting this attribute to true (i.e., a non-zero value)
 *    enables color reduction, and setting it to false (i.e., zero) disables color
 *    reduction. If set to false, the colorReductionAmt attribute (described below) is
 *    ignored.
 *
 *    The colorReductionAmt attribute is a floating point value in the range [0, 1]
 *    that controls how much color reduction to perform. When this attribute is set to
 *    0, minimum color reduction is applied. When this attribute is set to 1, maximum
 *    color reduction is applied: pixels will be rendered completely desaturated (i.e.,
 *    no color at all). Larger values are usually needed at smaller point sizes and for
 *    typefaces with thin strokes.
 *
 *    It is important to note that when the useColorReduction attribute is set to true,
 *    Saffron always performs some amount of color reduction, even when the
 *    colorReductionAmt attribute is set to its minimum value of 0. In other words,
 *    turning on color reduction and setting the colorReductionAmt attribute to 0 is
 *    not equivalent to turning off color reduction altogether (i.e., by setting the
 *    useColorReduction Boolean attribute to false).
 *
 *    Also note that setting the useColorReduction attribute to true and the
 *    colorReductionAmt attribute to 1 (when LCD rendering) is not equivalent to CRT
 *    rendering. The rendered text will appear different because 3 samples are used per
 *    pixel in the former case, whereas only 1 sample is used per pixel in the latter
 *    case. In general, rendering quality will be higher in the former case, but
 *    performance will be slower.
 *
 *    Finally, the color reduction feature is only relevant to LCD rendering. The two
 *    attributes described above are ignored entirely during CRT rendering.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: TYPESETTING
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Although this library does not typeset glyphs, it provides feedback to the 
 *    application that can be used during typesetting; we therefore introduce some
 *    basic concepts and terminology here. For more details, see, e.g., Donald E. 
 *    Knuth, "Tex and Metafont: New Directions in Typesetting", Digital Press.
 *
 *    In typesetting, the 'baseline' of a line of text is an imaginary line that is
 *    used to guide the placement of glyphs. The baseline can be horizontal (e.g., when
 *    typesetting Latin fonts) or vertical (e.g., when typesetting Japanese fonts). The
 *    'pen position' is a virtual point located on the baseline that is used to locate
 *    glyphs. Conventionally (and in this library), the pen position determines the
 *    placement of the glyph origin.
 *
 *    Text is typeset and rendered by incrementing the pen position -- either to the
 *    left or right for horizontal baselines, or up or down for vertical baselines. The
 *    distance between two successive pen positions is glyph-specific and is called the
 *    'advance width'.
 *
 *    In this library, pen positions are specified by the application for each glyph to
 *    be rendered. Adjustments to these pen positions (which consist of incremental
 *    scales and translations) may be required depending on the application's use of
 *    grid fitting, as explained in the following three cases:
 *
 *    1) When grid fitting is disabled, glyph density images are rendered with glyph
 *       origins placed precisely at the specified pen positions. In this case, the
 *       grid fitting translation adjustments are set to zero and the grid fitting
 *       scale adjustments are effectively set to one.
 *
 *    2) When grid fitting is enabled using BAZ alignment zones, glyphs may be
 *       incrementally scaled and translated to align strong vertical and horizontal
 *       glyph edges and characteristic distances (e.g., cap heights) to the pixel grid
 *       or to the sub-pixel grid, thereby providing better contrast, uniform stroke
 *       weights, and consistent characteristic distances. 
 *
 *    3) When grid fitting is enabled using MAZ alignment zones, strong vertical and
 *       horizontal glyph edges will be detected and aligned to the pixel grid
 *       dynamically during rendering, thereby providing better contrast and uniform
 *       stroke weights. Unlike case 2 above, grid fitting using MAZ alignment zones
 *       does not require changes to the pen position, advance width, or other font
 *       metrics. Therefore, this library returns grid fitting translation adjustments
 *       that are set to zero and grid fitting scale adjustments that are effectively
 *       set to one for each glyph. Applications that apply these grid fitting
 *       adjustments during typesetting will obtain the same results (i.e., the same
 *       text layout) as if grid fitting is disabled. Consequently, enabling MAZ grid
 *       fitting improves the appearance of glyphs without affecting their placement.
 *
 *    While grid fitting is advised for small point sizes (e.g., less than 30 point on
 *    a 72 dpi device), it is not necessary for larger point sizes, rotated glyphs, or
 *    animated type. Hence, there are four common scenarios regarding grid fitting and
 *    the use of grid alignment adjustments:
 *    
 *    1) Grid fitting is disabled -- in this scenario, each glyph is placed precisely
 *       at the requested pen position and the grid alignment adjustments can be
 *       ignored or applied with identical results. As a consequence, a prescribed
 *       layout can be maintained exactly but the rendering quality is compromised at
 *       small point sizes.
 *
 *    3) Grid fitting is enabled using alignment zones -- in this scenario, each
 *       glyph is placed precisely at the requested pen position and no grid alignment
 *       adjustments are applied. Consequently, enabling BAZ or MAZ grid fitting 
 *       improves the appearance of glyphs without affecting their placement.
 *    
 *    When typesetting text at small point sizes, it is important to note that 
 *    antialiasing increases the perceived size of each glyph, thereby decreasing     
 *    the space between adjacent characters. Adding extra space (e.g., equal to the 
 *    filter radius) between glyphs during typesetting can result in more readable 
 *    text.
 *
 *    Finally, optimal metric-preserving non-CJK typesetting when grid fitting requires
 *    more than just placing glyphs at pen positions mandated by a prescribed layout
 *    (see, e.g., Microsoft's approach for formatting text in GDI+ which adjusts space
 *    bands during glyph placement).
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: RENDERING CJK GLYPHS WITH MULTIPLE ALIGNMENT ZONES
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    If requested, BAZ or MAZ alignment zones are detected and applied dynamically to glyphs
 *    during hinting. This automatic grid fitting process significantly improves the
 *    appearance of both outline-based CJK glyphs and stroke-based CJK glyphs. Although
 *    the MAZ alignment zone detection and grid fitting system can be applied to any
 *    glyph (including non-CJK glyphs), the system is designed and optimized for CJK
 *    glyphs. Applications are strongly discouraged from using MAZ alignment zones to
 *    grid fit non-CJK glyphs.
 *
 *    Grid fitting using MAZ alignment zones can be enabled by setting the gridFitType
 *    element of the ADFRenderAttrs data structure to ADF_GRID_FIT_MAZ_PIXEL (see the
 *    Rendering section below for details).
 *
 *    There are two issues that applications need to be aware of when using BAZ/MAZ
 *    alignment zones:
 *
 *    1) In general, this library returns grid fitting adjustments which may be used by
 *       the application to perform typesetting (i.e., to compute the pen position of
 *       each glyph). When grid fitting is enabled using BAZ/MAZ alignment zones, this
 *       library returns grid fitting translation adjustments that are set to zero and
 *       grid fitting scale adjustments that are effectively set to one. Applications
 *       that apply these grid fitting adjustments during typesetting will obtain the
 *       same results (i.e., the same text layout) as if grid fitting is disabled.
 *       Consequently, BAZ/MAZ alignment zones improve the appearance of glyphs without
 *       affecting their placement.
 *
 *    2) The 'alignment behavior' of the MAZ alignment zone detection and grid fitting
 *       system (i.e., the manner in which strong vertical and horizontal glyph edges
 *       are aligned to the pixel grid) is independent of the requested pen position.
 *       For example, the same glyph placed at two different pen positions (e.g.,
 *       (20.7,25.8) and (30.2,29.3)) will appear identical when rendered.
 *       Consequently, when caching density images, only one version of the glyph needs
 *       to be stored into the cache.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    USAGE NOTE: RENDERING APPLICATION-HINTED GLYPHS
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Applications can perform their own grid fitting (e.g., by using TrueType hints)
 *    instead of using the automatic hinting (based on BAZ or MAZ alignment zones)
 *    provided by this library. This is useful for Unicode character sets not supported
 *    by the current implementations of the BAZ and MAZ alignment zone detection and
 *    grid fitting systems. Applications that perform their own grid fitting must
 *    follow certain steps to ensure that this library renders application-hinted
 *    glyphs correctly. These steps are described below in the Rendering section.

 *    MATH MODE SELECTION
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Explicit ADFs are always processed internally using floating point arithmetic.
 *    Implicit ADFs, however, can be processed internally using either floating point
 *    arithmetic or fixed point arithmetic. The latter option provides better
 *    performance on systems that lack floating point hardware support. 
 *
 *    When fixed point arithmetic is enabled, applications must ensure that certain
 *    rendering parameters lie within specific ranges. These range requirements are
 *    described below.
 *
 *    The ADF_MATH_MODE macro controls the type of arithmetic used internally by the
 *    following API functions:
 *
 *      - ADFGenerateADF()
 *      - ADFRenderSetup()
 *      - ADFRenderSetupFromPath()
 *      - ADFRenderGlyph()
 *      - ADFPositionCachedImage()
 *      - ADFInitAlgnZoneDetection()
 *      - ADFDetectAlgnZones()
 *
 *    ADF_MATH_MODE must be set to one of the following constants:
 *
 *      - ADF_MATH_FIXED_C_32
 *      - ADF_MATH_FIXED_C_64
 *      - ADF_MATH_FIXED_ASM_X86
 *
 *    If ADF_MATH_MODE is set to ADF_MATH_FIXED_C_32, this library uses a fixed point
 *    implementation for the above API functions. This fixed point implementation is
 *    written in ANSI C and is portable across systems that support 32-bit integers and
 *    two's complement arithmetic.
 *
 *    If ADF_MATH_MODE is set to ADF_MATH_FIXED_C_64, this library uses a fixed point
 *    implementation for the above API functions. This fixed point implementation is
 *    portable across systems that support 32-bit integers, 64-bit integers, and two's
 *    complement arithmetic. Applications must define ADF_I64 appropriately (see
 *    below). This implementation requires that the system performs sign extension when
 *    the left operand of a right shift is a signed integer. In general, this
 *    implementation is significantly faster than ADF_MATH_FIXED_C_32.
 *
 *    If ADF_MATH_MODE is set to ADF_MATH_FIXED_ASM_X86, this library uses a fixed
 *    point implementation for the above API functions. This fixed point implementation
 *    is written in optimized x86 assembly. Applications must define ADF_I64
 *    appropriately (see below). This implementation compiles only to x86-based systems
 *    (e.g., Pentium M systems) and is usually significantly faster than
 *    ADF_MATH_FIXED_C_64.
 *
 *    All of the fixed point implementations provide bit-identical results with each
 *    other.
 *
 *    Note that the other API functions (i.e., all API functions described in this file
 *    except the ones listed above) use only integer arithmetic and therefore ignore
 *    the setting of ADF_MATH_MODE.
 *
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    When fixed point arithmetic is enabled, applications must ensure that certain
 *    rendering parameters lie within specific ranges. These range requirements are
 *    as follows:
 *
 *      1. All floating point elements in the ADFRenderAttrs and ADFPath data
 *         structures (see below) must be in the range [-32767, 32767].
 *
 *      2. The scaleX and scaleY elements in the ADFRenderAttrs data structure must be
 *         non-negative.
 *
 *      3. The outsideCutoff and insideCutoff elements in the ADFRenderAttrs data
 *         structure must be in the range [-20, 20]. Furthermore, outsideCutoff must be
 *         less than or equal to insideCutoff.
 *
 *      4. The gamma element in the ADFRenderAttrs data structure must be positive.
 *
 *      5. The pointSize, dpi, scaleX, and scaleY elements in the ADFRenderAttrs data
 *         structure must satisfy the following two inequalities:
 *
 *             0 <= (pointSize * dpi * scaleX / 72) <= 2048
 *             0 <= (pointSize * dpi * scaleY / 72) <= 2048
 *
 *         For example, if dpi is 72 and scaleX and scaleY are both 1, then pointSize
 *         must lie in the range [0, 2048].
 *
 *         If the ADFPath represents a stroke-based glyph, then the pointSize, dpi,
 *         scaleX, and scaleY elements of the ADFRenderAttrs data structure and the
 *         pathWidth and fontUnitsPerEM elements of the ADFPath data structure must
 *         also satisfy the following two inequalities:
 *
 *             0 <= (pointSize * dpi * scaleX * pathWidth / fontUnitsPerEM) <= 7200
 *             0 <= (pointSize * dpi * scaleY * pathWidth / fontUnitsPerEM) <= 7200
 *
 *      6. The fontUnitsPerEM element in the ADFPath data structure must lie in the
 *         range (0,2048].

 *    GLYPH REPRESENTATION (ADFPATHS)
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Glyphs are represented by the ADFPath data structure. Similar to Postscript, an
 *    ADFPath is composed of a series of pen commands (e.g., moveto, lineto, and
 *    curveto) that define a closed shape for an outline-based glyph or a set of stroke
 *    skeletons for a stroke-based glyph. Note that a skeleton of a stroke-based glyph
 *    can be open (e.g., for a 'u') or closed (e.g., for an 'o'). The pen commands
 *    specify the movement and drawing of a virtual pen and allow both line segments
 *    and quadratic Bezier curve segments to be drawn. The endpoints and the control
 *    vertices of each segment are specified in floating point font units. This library
 *    follows the TrueType convention for rendering glyphs, where rasterization is
 *    performed using samples located at pixel centers. For outline-based glyphs, we
 *    assume a non-zero winding rule for distinguishing between filled and unfilled
 *    areas of the shape. The ADFPath consists of the following elements:
 *
 *    pathType: ADF_OUTLINE_PATH or ADF_UNIFORM_STROKE_PATH. This element indicates
 *    whether the ADFPath represents an outline-based glyph (e.g., from a TrueType
 *    font) comprising a set of closed contours (ADF_OUTLINE_PATH) or a uniform-width
 *    stroke-based glyph comprising a stroke width and a set of stroke skeletons
 *    representing the centerlines of the glyph (ADF_UNIFORM_STROKE_PATH). Note that
 *    uniform-width stroke-based glyphs are rendered with round endcaps.
 *
 *    pathWidth: The stroke width of a uniform-width stroke-based glyph in floating
 *    point font units. pathWidth is used only when pathType is
 *    ADF_UNIFORM_STROKE_PATH. Note that the stroke width is not a rendering parameter
 *    but an integral part of the glyph design. Hence, two uniform-width stroke-based
 *    glyphs with the same set of stroke skeletons but different stroke widths
 *    represent different glyphs (e.g., for regular and bold versions of a character).
 *
 *    glyphMinX, glyphMinY, glyphMaxX, glyphMaxY: The exact bounding box of the glyph
 *    in floating point font units. If the pathType is ADF_UNIFORM_STROKE_PATH, these
 *    values define the exact bounding box of the pen commands that comprise the stroke
 *    skeletons (i.e., the bounding box does not account for the stroke width (i.e.,
 *    pathWidth)).
 *
 *    fontUnitsPerEM: The em box size in floating point font units (i.e., font units 
 *    per em).
 *
 *    charCode: The Unicode character code of the glyph. A zero character code 
 *    indicates that the character code is not available.
 *
 *    numContours: For an outline-based glyph, the number of closed contours of the 
 *    glyph, where each contour is described by a series of pen commands and begins 
 *    with a moveto command. This element is not used when pathType is 
 *    ADF_UNIFORM_STROKE_PATH.
 *
 *    numPenCmds: The total number of pen commands in the ADFPath.
 *
 *    penCmds: A pointer to a contiguous block of fixed-sized pen commands defining the
 *    glyph shape. The first command of each contour or stroke skeleton must be a
 *    moveto command. For an outline-based glyph, the x and y coordinates of the last
 *    command of each contour must equal the x and y coordinates of the contour's
 *    initial moveto command.
 *
 *    appData: A pointer to application specific data.

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Attributes for generating an ADF from an ADFPath. These attributes are ignored
 *    when generating implicit ADFs, but are required when generating explicit ADFs.
 *
 *    Explicit ADFs are represented as a spatial hierarchy of explicit ADF cells, where
 *    each explicit ADF cell contains a set of sampled distance values and a
 *    reconstruction method which is used to reconstruct the distance field within the
 *    explicit ADF cell. Explicit ADFs are generated using top-down spatial
 *    subdivision; maxLevel limits the depth of the spatial hierarchy. During explicit
 *    ADF generation, each explicit ADF cell is subdivided until maxLevel is reached or
 *    until the error between the reconstructed distance field and the true distance
 *    field of the ADFPath is less than maxError within the explicit ADF cell. In
 *    applications that only require an accurate representation of the edge of the
 *    ADFPath, such as in glyph rendering, it is not necessary for explicit ADF cells
 *    that do not contain the edge to meet the maxError constraint. In this case,
 *    distEps should be set to 0. However, some applications (e.g., applications that
 *    perform collision detection between glyphs) require an accurate representation of
 *    the distance field away from the edge. A positive distEps will force explicit ADF
 *    cells within distEps of the edge to meet the maxError constraint. distEps is
 *    expressed in ADF units.
 *

 *    ALIGNMENT ZONES
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Alignment zones identify strong vertical and horizontal edges of glyphs and 
 *    characteristic distances (i.e., zones) of a typeface (e.g., baseline to x-height 
 *    and baseline to cap-height distances). Alignment zones are determined directly
 *    from the ADF of each glyph and are used to build the appropriate transformation
 *    needed for grid fitting each ADF to the pixel grid or to the sub-pixel grid.
 *
 *    This library supports two alignment zone systems: Basic Alignment Zones (BAZ)
 *    and Multiple Alignment Zones (MAZ). The important difference between
 *    these two alignment zone systems:
 *
 *        1) BAZ alignment zones are designed and optimized for non-CJK glyphs (e.g.,
 *           Latin or Hebrew glyphs), whereas MAZ alignment zones are designed and
 *           optimized for CJK glyphs.
 *
 *
 *    Note that initialization requires the ADFPaths of a small set of glyphs in the
 *    typeface from which characteristic distances (i.e., zones) are determined. Hence,
 *    the application must supply a callback function for fetching the ADFPath of an
 *    arbitrary glyph from the typeface; when the ADFPath has been processed and is no
 *    longer needed, a corresponding callback function for 'releasing' the ADFPath is
 *    invoked. The release callback function can be used to free the ADFPath if the
 *    corresponding fetch callback function allocated the ADFPath on demand.
 *
 *    The current implementation supports MAZ alignment zone detection for all Unicode
 *    character code sets. However, MAZ alignment zones are designed and optimized for
 *    CJK glyphs. Applications are strongly discouraged from using MAZ alignment zones
 *    to grid fit non-CJK glyphs.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *    A callback function provided by the application and invoked by 
 *    ADFInitAlgnZoneDetection() to fetch the ADFPath of a specified glyph of the

 *    appInst is the application instance data provided by the application when 
 *    ADFInitSystem() was invoked (it can be used for memory allocation). fontID is an 
 *    opaque pointer provided by the application to ADFInitAlgnZoneDetection() that

 *    RENDERING

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    ADF rendering proceeds in four steps:
 *    
 *    1) Application rendering attributes, such as point size and display mode, are
 *       set by the application for a particular ADF glyph. These attributes are 
 *       defined in the ADFRenderAttrs data structure.
 *
 *    2) The application rendering attributes are then processed by ADFRenderSetup()
 *       to determine:
 *     
 *       a) ADFRenderGlyphData, a structure containing data, such as the rendering
 *          transformation, required by ADFRenderGlyph() to render the ADF glyph 
 *          according to the application rendering attributes.
 *
 *       b) ADFRenderImageAttrs, a structure containing attributes, such as the image 
 *          size and image origin, required by the application to prepare a density 
 *          image for rendering the ADF glyph. The image size can be used by the 
 *          application to allocate a density image via ADFCreateImage(); the image 
 *          origin specifies the location of the bottom-left corner of the density 
 *          image in integer pixel coordinates. This location can be used by the 
 *          application to position the density image in the display buffer when 
 *          compositing.
 *
 *       c) ADFTypesetAttrs, a structure containing attributes required by the 
 *          application for adjusting the font metrics due to grid fitting.
 *
 *       d) ADFCacheGlyphData, a structure containing data required by the application 
 *          for positioning and typesetting a cached density image of the ADF glyph
 *          via ADFPositionCachedImage(). Refer to ADFPositionCachedImage() for an 
 *          overview on typesetting cached density images.
 *
 *    3) A density image of the required size is prepared by the application (e.g., 
 *       allocated via ADFCreateImage()).
 *
 *    4) ADFRenderGlyph() is invoked by the application to render the ADF glyph into
 *       the prepared density image using the corresponding ADFRenderGlyphData. If
 *       requested, ADFRenderGlyph() performs MAZ alignment zone detection and grid
 *       fitting on the ADF glyph during the rendering process.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    ADFRenderAttrs (set by the application):
 *
 *    penX, penY: The x and y coordinates of the pen position, which determines the 
 *    placement of the ADF glyph origin. penX and penY are specified in floating 
 *    point pixel coordinates.
 *    
 *    pointSize: The requested point size for the ADF glyph.
 *
 *    dpi: The dots-per-inch of the display device.
 *
 *    scaleX, scaleY: Additional x and y scale factors for scaling the ADF glyph 
 *    beyond the requested point size. If the ADF glyph is an explicit ADF, non-uniform 
 *    scaling (i.e., where scaleX does not equal scaleY) distorts the distance field of 
 *    the ADF glyph, which can result in poor quality antialiasing. If the ADF glyph is 
 *    an implicit ADF, non-uniform scaling has no negative impact on the quality of the 
 *    antialiasing.
 *    
 *    rotationPtX, rotationPtY: The x and y coordinates of the center of rotation 
 *    for the ADF glyph. rotationPtX and rotationPtY are specified in floating point
 *    pixel coordinates.
 *
 *    rotationAngle: The rotation angle applied to the ADF glyph. rotationAngle is 
 *    specified in radians. Note that grid fitting is automatically disabled when a
 *    non-zero rotationAngle is specified.
 *
 *    displayMode: ADF_REND_MODE_CRT, ADF_REND_MODE_RGBv, ADF_REND_MODE_BGRv, 
 *    ADF_REND_MODE_RGBh, or ADF_REND_MODE_BGRh. This element determines whether 
 *    the ADF glyph is rendered in CRT mode (ADF_REND_MODE_CRT) or LCD mode (all
 *    others). If an LCD mode is chosen, displayMode also specifies the physical 
 *    layout of the display's sub-pixels, i.e., whether the display is horizontally
 *    or vertically striped, and whether the striping is in RGB or BGR order. This 
 *    library assumes that the striped sub-pixels have identical dimensions.
 *
 *    gridFitType: ADF_GRID_FIT_NONE, ADF_GRID_FIT_PIXEL, ADF_GRID_FIT_SUB_PIXEL, or
 *    ADF_GRID_FIT_BAZ_PIXEL, ADF_GRID_FIT_MAZ_PIXEL. ADF_GRID_FIT_NONE disables grid 
 *    fitting. ADF_GRID_FIT_PIXEL and ADF_GRID_FIT_PIXEL are not used by iType.
 *    ADF_GRID_FIT_MAZ_PIXEL aligns a glyph to the pixel grid using MAZ alignment zones.
 *    ADF_GRID_FIT_BAZ_PIXEL aligns a glyph to the pixel grid using BAZ alignment zones.
 *
 *    outsideCutoff, insideCutoff: The filter cutoff values for the mapping function
 *    which maps ADF distances to density values as described above in Usage Note:
 *    Continuous Stroke Modulation. outsideCutoff and insideCutoff are specified in
 *    floating point pixel coordinates.
 *
 *    gamma: The exponent of the gamma curve mapping ADF distances to density values 
 *    as described above in Usage Note: Continuous Stroke Modulation.
 *
 *    useColorReduction: The Boolean flag that enables color reduction during LCD
 *    rendering. Setting this variable to true enables color reduction. Setting this
 *    variable to false disables color reduction. This variable is ignored during CRT
 *    rendering (i.e., when displayMode is set to ADF_REND_MODE_CRT).
 *
 *    colorReductionAmt: If useColorReduction is set to true, this variable controls
 *    the amount of color reduction applied during LCD rendering. The value must lie in
 *    the range [0, 1]. A value of 0 specifies minimum color reduction. A value of 1
 *    specifies maximum color reduction: pixels will be completely desaturated (i.e.,
 *    no color at all). Note that a value of 0 will still cause some amount of color
 *    reduction to be performed; it will NOT give the same results as turning off color
 *    reduction entirely (i.e., by setting useColorReduction to false). This variable
 *    is ignored if useColorReduction is set to false. This variable is also ignored if 
 *    displayMode is set to ADF_REND_MODE_CRT.
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    Applications can perform their own grid fitting instead of using the automatic
 *    hinting (based on BAZ or MAZ alignment zones) provided by this library. In order
 *    to render application-hinted glyphs correctly, applications must perform certain
 *    steps to ensure that this library makes no adjustments to the points (i.e., the x
 *    and y coordinates) that define the hinted glyphs.
 *
 *    The steps required to set up an ADFPath for an application-hinted glyph are:
 *
 *    1) The application obtains the points (in font units) that define the glyph.
 *
 *    2) The application scales the coordinates of each point to pixel coordinates. For
 *       example, if the desired ppem is 10.0 and the em box size (in font units) is
 *       2048.0, the application scales the coordinates of each point by 10.0 / 2048.0.
 *
 *    3) The application applies its own grid fitting to the point data in pixel
 *       coordinates (e.g., by using TrueType hints). If the glyph is a uniform-width
 *       stroke-based glyph, the application also determines the hinted stroke width
 *       (typically an integral value).
 *
 *    4) The application sets the ADFPath data structure. In particular:
 *         - The application sets fontUnitsPerEM to the ppem value (e.g., 10.0).
 *         - The application specifies the coordinates of each pen command in floating
 *           point pixel coordinates (instead of in floating point font units).
 *         - The application specifies the glyph's bounding box (i.e., glyphMinX,
 *           glyphMinY, glyphMaxX, glyphMaxY) in floating point pixel coordinates
 *           (instead of in floating point font units).
 *         - If the glyph is a uniform-width stroke-based glyph, the application sets
 *           pathWidth to the (integral) hinted stroke width in floating point pixel
 *           coordinates (instead of in floating point font units).
 *
 *    After the application generates an ADF from the ADFPath, ADF rendering of an
 *    application-hinted glyph proceeds as described above, except that the application
 *    must set certain fields of the ADFRenderAttrs data structure as follows:
 *         - The application sets dpi to 72.
 *         - The application sets both scaleX and scaleY to 1.
 *         - The application sets gridFitType to ADF_GRID_FIT_NONE.

/**
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    POSITIONING AND TYPESETTING CACHED DENSITY IMAGES:
 *
 *    Given a new pen position for a cached density image, ADFPositionCachedImage()
 *    determines the new image origin, the new image sub-pixel type (if sub-pixel grid
 *    fitting was specified when the cached density image was rendered), and the new
 *    typesetting attributes for the cached density image whose cached glyph data is
 *    given by cacheGlyphData (which is determined via ADFRenderSetup()). This function
 *    assumes that the cached density image was grid fit to either the pixel grid or
 *    the sub-pixel grid; determining the image placement and typesetting attributes
 *    for cached density images that were not grid fit is application-dependent (it
 *    typically requires application-specific quantizing of rendering attributes such
 *    as the pen position) and is not supported by this function.
 *
 *    Upon entry, renderAttrs must contain the new pen position (penX, penY) for the
 *    ADF glyph represented by the cached density image. Upon exit:
 *
 *    1) renderImageAttrs contains the new image origin for the cached density image 
 *       and the new image sub-pixel type (if sub-pixel grid fitting was specified when 
 *       the cached density image was rendered) based on the new pen position. Note 
 *       that the image width and height in renderImageAttrs are not set by this 
 *       function (the width and height of the cached density image are invariant to 
 *       pen position changes and therefore are not recomputed).
 *
 *    2) typesetAttrs contains the new typesetting attributes for the cached density 
 *       image based on the new pen position.
 *
 *
 *    WHEN GRID FITTING TO THE PIXEL GRID:
 *
 *    When caching density images and grid fitting to the pixel grid using either BAZ
 *    or MAZ alignment zones, a typical application can augment the ADF rendering
 *    process as follows to support the typesetting of cached density images:
 *
 *    1) When rendering the ADF glyph for the first time
 *       a) Invoke ADFRenderSetup() to determine the cacheGlyphData for the ADF glyph 
 *          and the given renderAttrs
 *       b) Create a density image with application-specific data for storing the 
 *          cacheGlyphData
 *       c) Invoke ADFRenderGlyph() to render the ADF glyph into the density image
 *       d) Store the cacheGlyphData as appData in the density image
 *       e) Insert the density image into the cache
 *       f) Typeset the density image according to the typesetAttrs and 
 *          renderImageAttrs determined by ADFRenderSetup()
 *
 *    2) When typesetting a cached density image for a new pen position
 *       a) Determine the new typesetAttrs and renderImageAttrs via 
 *          ADFPositionCachedImage() using the cacheGlyphData stored as 
 *          application-specific data in the cached density image
 *       b) Typeset the density image according to the new typesetAttrs and 
 *          renderImageAttrs
 *
 *
 *    WHEN GRID FITTING TO THE SUB-PIXEL GRID:
 *
 *    When caching density images and grid fitting to the sub-pixel grid using 
 *    alignment zones, up to three density images must be cached for renderAttrs which
 *    differ only by the pen position, where each image corresponds to the alignment of
 *    the ADF glyph with a different sub-pixel. For a new pen position, the appropriate
 *    density image and the new typesetAttrs and renderImageAttrs can be determined
 *    from the new pen position and the cacheGlyphData of any of the three density
 *    images.
 *
 *    Determining the placement and typesetting of a cached density image when grid
 *    fitting to the sub-pixel grid is similar to the approach outlined for grid
 *    fitting to the pixel grid but requires a two-step cache-retrieval process:
 *
 *    1) Determine the new image origin, new image sub-pixel type, and new typesetAttrs 
 *       via ADFPositionCachedImage() using the cacheGlyphData of any of the three 
 *       cached density images.
 *
 *    2) Retrieve the appropriate density image from the cache (i.e., the density image 
 *       which corresponds to the new image sub-pixel type) and typeset the density 
 *       image according to the new typesetAttrs and renderImageAttrs determined in
 *       step 1.
 *
 *    Three plausible approaches for storing and retrieving cacheGlyphData are outlined 
 *    here:
 *
 *    1) Store cacheGlyphData as application-specific data for every cached density 
 *       image. In this approach, the application can query the cache for any of the 
 *       three density images to retrieve the cacheGlyphData required by 
 *       ADFPositionCachedImage().
 *
 *    2) Store cacheGlyphData as application-specific data for a 'data image' of zero 
 *       width and height (using a cache key similar to the key used for the cached 
 *       density image) and query the cache for the data image to retrieve the
 *       cacheGlyphData required by ADFPositionCachedImage().
 *
 *    3) Store cacheGlyphData in a glyph- and renderAttrs-dependent array managed 
 *       by the application and fetch the cacheGlyphData required by 
 *       ADFPositionCachedImage() accordingly.

 *    REVISION HISTORY
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    1)    05-26-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken    
 *        Initial creation 
 *        [Version 0.1]
 *
 *    2)    06-04-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken    
 *        Rewrote Version 0.1 using a toolkit approach 
 *        [Version 0.2]
 *
 *    3)    06-16-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken    
 *        Made numerous clarifications, corrections, and enhancements to the 
 *        documentation. Changed alignment zones from an opaque block to an explicit 
 *        64-bit value - this required modifications to ADFPath and to the alignment
 *        zone detection API. 
 *        [Version 0.3]
 *
 *    4)    06-21-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Switched from 16-bit Unicode values to 32-bit Unicode values. Added
 *        filename to file for identification when printed. Added new cache entry
 *        point ADFGetCacheKeys() for returning the keys of all the elements of a
 *        specified cache.
 *        [Version 0.4]
 *
 *    5)    07-30-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added the ability to store application-specific data along with a density 
 *        image. Restricted the width and height fields of a density image to ADF_U16s 
 *        (formerly ADF_U32s). Replaced the pixelToADFScaleX and pixelToADFScaleY
 *        scale factors in the ADFRenderGlyphData data structure with a single scale 
 *        factor filterCutoffScale. Switched from 64-bit alignment zones to 128-bit
 *        alignment zones (i.e., 4 ADF_F32s) and added an alignment zone mask to the
 *        ADFPath data structure. Provided logical defaults for typesetting 
 *        adjustments in ADFTypesetAttrs when grid fitting is disabled.
 *        [Version 0.5]
 *
 *    6)    08-25-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Replaced 128-bit alignment zones (i.e., 4 ADF_F32s) with 64-bit alignment 
 *        zones (i.e., 2 ADF_U32s). Added ADFPositionCachedImage() and associated data 
 *        structures.
 *        [Version 0.6]
 *
 *    7)    09-15-2004
 *        Sarah Frisken and Ronald Perry
 *        Switched from ADF units to font units for representing alignment zones. Added
 *        support of alignment zones for extended character sets (Latin-1 Supplement,
 *        Latin Extended-A, and a small subset of Latin Extended-B). Improved the 
 *        precision and robustness of alignment zone detection. Removed large stack
 *        allocations.
 *
 *    8)    10-08-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added clarifications to the documentation regarding the automatic disabling 
 *        of grid fitting when rendering rotated type.
 *        [Version 0.7]
 *
 *    9)    10-17-2004
 *        Sarah Frisken and Ronald Perry
 *        Added cluster trees for accelerating explicit ADF generation. 
 *
 *    10) 10-30-2004
 *        Sarah Frisken and Ronald Perry
 *        Added explicit ADF compression by representing all distance values and other
 *        cell data (i.e., corner positions and tangent vectors) as 16-bit fixed-point
 *        values rather than 32-bit floating point values. SCBuildADFQuadtree()
 *        performs explicit ADF compression (conversion from floating point to
 *        fixed-point for each value) when an explicit ADF tree is built;
 *        ADFReconstructDist() performs on-demand decompression of a specified cell
 *        (conversion from fixed-point to floating point for each value of the
 *        specified cell) when reconstructing a distance at a sample point within the
 *        specified cell. Corner points are now stored in absolute ADF coordinates
 *        rather than cell relative coordinate; this change provided better accuracy
 *        when converting corner points from floating point to fixed-point. The 16-bit
 *        fixed-point representation provides enough accuracy to allow 1000 ppem glyphs
 *        to be rendered identically to their floating point counterparts.
 *
 *    11) 11-19-2004
 *        Sarah Frisken and Ronald Perry
 *        Changed how 5's and 7's are grid fit to improve baseline consistency when
 *        rendering numerical sequences. Normalized the accumulated edge filter values
 *        by the sampling resolution and changed the default edge threshold value
 *        accordingly. This reduces the dependency of the detected edges for a given
 *        threshold value on the sampling resolution. Changed from floating point
 *        limits to integer limits for defining the known exterior region of the ADF
 *        glyph when computing the distance map required for edge detection. This
 *        accelerated the alignment zone computation and eliminated the possibility of
 *        detecting false edges on the bounding box of the glyph. Redesigned the method
 *        for identifying invalid (i.e., too small) x and y grid fitting ranges to
 *        permit the detection system to recover from invalid ranges and to continue
 *        its search. Reduced the number of maximum explicit special cell data elements
 *        SC_MAX_NUM_SCDATA thereby decreasing the worst-case maximum instance size of
 *        the Saffron library.
 *
 *    12) 11-19-2004
 *        Sarah Frisken and Ronald Perry
 *        Changed both ADFRenderSetup() and ADFPositionCachedImage() to determine the
 *        optimal image width and height required to render the entire glyph for any
 *        placement of the ADF on the pixel or sub-pixel grid based on the vertical and
 *        horizontal striping of the display device. Added support for grid fitting to
 *        the sub-pixel when rendering in CRT mode, thereby permitting glyph placement
 *        to 1/6th of a pixel in x for maintaining a prescribed layout.
 *
 *    13) 12-02-2004
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added ADFRenderSetupFromPath() as an alternative to ADFRenderSetup().
 *        [Version 0.8]
 *
 *    14) 12-07-2004
 *        Sarah Frisken and Ronald Perry
 *        Increased the DetectEdges() edge threshold (AZ_EDGE_THRESHOLD) from 0.02f
 *        to 0.04f to correct the alignment zones for various glyphs of italic 
 *        typefaces.
 *
 *    15) 04-23-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken    
 *        Added GetDistFromFixPtBiquadraticCell() to allow ADFReconstructDist() to
 *        reconstruct distance values without the use of a temporary floating point
 *        buffer, thus accelerating explicit ADF rendering times. Modified
 *        ADFReconstructDist() to exploit this new functionality.
 *
 *    16) 05-03-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken    
 *        Modified ADFRenderGlyphExplicit() to handle unrotated and rotated glyphs
 *        separately when in CRT mode, thus permitting unrotated glyphs (the common
 *        case) to be accelerated.
 *
 *    17) 05-05-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken 
 *        Modified ADFRenderGlyphExplicit() to handle unrotated and rotated glyphs
 *        separately when in LCD mode, thus permitting unrotated glyphs (the common
 *        case) to be accelerated.
 *
 *    18) 05-06-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken    
 *        Added space leaping to ADFRenderGlyphExplicit() to accelerate the rendering
 *        of unrotated glyphs in LCD mode.
 *
 *    19) 07-13-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added support for Devanagari and Arabic alignment zone detection.
 *        [Version 0.9]
 *
 *    20) 07-20-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added support for Hebrew and Thai alignment zone detection.
 *        [Version 1.0]
 *
 *    21) 09-07-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Made numerous performance enhancements to ADF generation.
 *        [Version 1.1]
 *
 *    22) 12-27-2005
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added support for both explicit and implicit ADFs.
 *        [Version 2.0]
 *
 *    23) 03-06-2006
 *        Ronald Perry and Sarah Frisken
 *        Reworked the logic in ADFRenderSetup() for determining the transformation 
 *        from ADF coordinates to image coordinates when a non-zero rotation angle is 
 *        specified (it didn't work when the rotation point did not equal the glyph 
 *        origin). Fixed an initialization error in ADFRenderSetup() which caused the 
 *        vertical and horizontal striping Booleans to be uninitialized in certain 
 *        cases (e.g., when rotating).
 *
 *    24) 03-20-2006
 *        Eric Chan, Ronald Perry, and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added a define for determining the API version number at runtime. Added
 *        application instance data (appInst) to the argument lists of the macros used
 *        by the system for memory allocation. Added an application callback function
 *        for releasing an ADFPath (see ADFReleaseGlyphCB) when performing
 *        ADFInitAlgnZoneDetection() on a specified typeface. Replaced libInst with
 *        appInst in the application callback function ADFGetGlyphCB thus allowing the
 *        application to perform memory allocation tasks when fetching an ADFPath. 
 *        Added support for color reduction during LCD rendering (see usage note).
 *        [Version 2.1]
 *
 *    25) 05-10-2006
 *        Eric Chan, Ronald Perry, and Sarah Frisken
 *        Optimized the implicit ADF rendering code. More specifically:
 *           - Added support for subdivision of curve segments into line segments.
 *             Removed all previous code related to processing curve cells.
 *           - Added two new functions, ProcessVerticalLineCell() and
 *             ProcessHorizontalLineCell(), which use implementations optimized
 *             for processing vertical and horizontal line cells, respectively.
 *           - Modified SetGlyphInterior() to use a temporary winding number buffer to
 *             accelerate the processing of interior spans.
 *           - Modified the color reduction implementation by replacing floating point
 *             arithmetic with integer arithmetic, thereby avoiding costly conversions
 *             between floating point values and integer values.
 *           - Modified MapDistBufferToImage() to skip color reduction in the common
 *             case that the RGB density values are all zero or all 255.
 *        Added several minor performance optimizations (e.g., inlined code and delayed
 *        square root computations). Fixed minor bugs and typos.
 *        [Version 2.2]
 *
 *    26) 07-17-2006
 *        Eric Chan, Ronald Perry, and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added support for processing (e.g., alignment zone detection and rendering)
 *        uniform-width stroke-based glyphs. Added support and documentation for the
 *        rendering of application-hinted glyphs. Modified both implicit and explicit
 *        ADF rendering to perform rasterization at pixel centers rather than at
 *        integer pixel coordinates.
 *        [Version 2.3]
 *
 *    27) 08-28-2006
 *        Eric Chan, Ronald Perry, and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added support for processing implicit ADFs with fixed point arithmetic (see
 *        the Math Mode Selection section above).
 *        [Version 3.0]
 *
 *    28) 05-07-2007
 *        Eric Chan, Ronald Perry, and Sarah Frisken
 *        Added support for the MAZ alignment zone detection and grid fitting system.
 *        [Version 3.1]
