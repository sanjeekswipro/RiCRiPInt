%
% Extension for the PrintTicket procset.
%
% This code handles JobXPSPTEmulation.
%
% Each callback function is called with arguments of the form:
%   setup_dict CallBackProc -
% where setup_dict contains the following entries (amongst others):
%   /RIPPrintTicket - The PrintTicket settings which we obtained from the RIP.
%   /scope          - The scope at which we're currently processing (/Job, /Document, /Page).
%   /DeviceDict     - A dictionary of settings which will eventually be used
%                     in calls to setpagedevice.
%   /PGBParamDict   - A dictionary of settings which will eventually be used
%                     in calls to setdevparams for the pagebuffer device.
%   /pt_key         - The name of the PrintTicket option which triggered this callback.
%   /pt_value       - Contains the data for the PrintTicket option which triggered this callback.
%
% For more information see ProcessTicket in the HqnXPSPrintTicket procset.
