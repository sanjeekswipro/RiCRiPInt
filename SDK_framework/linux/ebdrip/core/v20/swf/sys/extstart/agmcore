% A number of Adobe applications use a common PostScript library when
% generating EPS or PostScript. The code in that library makes some
% assumptions about the separation abilities of a RIP within which it
% will be run.
%
% Unfortunately the Harlequin ScriptWorks RIP is rather more flexible
% and powerful than the code can handle, especially as follows:
%
% *  ScriptWorks can be set to 'separate' a pre-separated job. It will
%    automatically detect the blank separations and omit them. 
%
% * ScriptWorks can dynamically add new spot color separations when objects
%   using them are found in a job file.
%
% * ScriptWorks can recombine, and even re-separate pre-separated jobs.
%
% The code below overrides some of the assumptions made by the Adobe code,
% leading to correct output.
