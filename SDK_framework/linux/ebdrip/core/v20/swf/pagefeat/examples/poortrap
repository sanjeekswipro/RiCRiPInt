% This simple page feature turns on the 'poor trap rule' parameter in TrapWorks.
% When considering whether two colors require a trap, the Red Book specifies
% that tint values in each colorant are compared. The default behaviour in
% TrapWorks (HqnPoorTrapRule false) is to compare neutral density components
% rather than tint values. This tends to result in fewer traps involving
% yellow and more with black, so that large density differences are trapped
% but unnecessary traps aren't generated in lighter colorants.
