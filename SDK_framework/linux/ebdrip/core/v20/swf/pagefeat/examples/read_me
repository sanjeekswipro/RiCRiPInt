EXAMPLE PAGE FEATURES
=====================

This file describes the concept behind the example page features supplied with ScriptWorks
and is not intended to be used as a Page Feature itself.

Page features in ScriptWorks are simply PostScript files which may be run at the beginning of 
every PostScript file processed by the RIP. Placing a file containing raw PostScript code
in the "SW:Page Features" folder on the Macintosh or the "SW\PAGEFEAT" directory on a PC
will allow that file to be selected as an Additional Feature on the Page Setup dialog inside 
the RIP.

Some of the features supplied with ScriptWorks are expected to be used as-is by a number of 
users. These include the color and bit-depth features, and 180 degree rotation.

Having said that, the original concept of Page features is that ScriptWorks OEMs, distributors
and end-users can all add their own functionality to the RIP by adding features to perform
specific tasks. The example features in this Examples sub-directory are intended as exactly
that - examples. If you find them useful as they stand then please use them. If they don't 
produce exactly the effect that you want then please change them (all we ask is that you 
retain the Harlequin copyright information, adding your own as appropriate).

The examples here include handling HPGL, PCL4 and Epson files by using the PostScript level 2
filter operator, adding crop and register marks to automatically separated pages and adding 
over-printing text such as 'Draft' or 'Confidential' across the page.

There are very few rules to remember:

a) Except for calls to 'setsystemparams' all environment changes introduced in a page feature
   are local to that job.
   
b) Page features should not execute the 'exitserver' operator, unless you are explicitly
   writing a 'download' feature.
   
c) If you think it might work - try it!

Virtually all you need to produce all the effects you can make is provided in the 'red book', 
PostScript Language Reference Manual, 2nd Ed (Adobe Systems Inc., ISBN 0-201018127-4, Pub: 
Adison Wesley, 1990).
