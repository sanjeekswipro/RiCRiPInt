% This file adds routines to be called on the %%BeginProcSet line in a file.
% If the BeginProcSet comment is not one which will be acted on by the auto 
% prep loading code then the text of the comment is searched for each 
% of the keys for procedures in HqnBeginProcsetDict in turn. When a matching key is 
% found the procedure is executed.

% Standard procedures are provided here to correct a known problems with FreeHand.
% An additional patch for XPress 3.3 spot colour vignettes is added by the Level 1
% separator procset.

% To add new patches use the routine HqnAddProcSet (in statusdict):
%	{ procedure } (text to match in BeginProcSet line) HqnAddProcSet
% The text used should be sufficiently unique to be sure that the procedure will not be
% called needlessly, but need not be the whole creator line.

% Please be careful when selecting names - adding a routine called /Aldus may well disable
% patches for FreeHand, or may itself be disabled by the FreeHand patch etc.

% Procedures should expect the text of the BeginProcSet line to be passed to them from the end of the 
% key name, e.g. if the key name is /Aldus and the  line reads:
%	%%BeginProcSet: Aldus Application
% then the string ( Application) will be passed through.

% In order for multiple procedures to be stacked this string must *NOT* be popped - 
% HqnAddProcSet will concatenate procedures as necessary and the string must still be available.
