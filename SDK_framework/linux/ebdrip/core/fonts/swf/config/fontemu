statusdict /FontEmulation <<

  % To disable emulation of a font that is in the database, such as an important
  % corporate font, so that the job will fail if the font is omitted:
  %
  % /TheFontName false

  % To use an existing font definition in the database to cover an identical
  % font with a different name, alias it like this:
  %
  % /MyFontName /DatabaseFontName

  % To override a database font with an updated definition, or add new fonts to
  % the emulation system (you will need a correctly formatted data string, the
  % format is not defined):
  %
  % /FontName <2211111111110077777711...776688664103a700aa4d4000fc6d0002>
