% This file is used to define a UID black list. The dictionary
% /FontUIDBlackList is defined in status dictionary. The keys of the
% dictionary entries are UID numbers. When a font is defined, if the font
% uses any such UID, the rip replaces that UID with a new unique value. Thus
% an entry in the black list prevents a particular UID being used for any
% font.
%
% Where font caching problems are due to the incorrect use of a UniqueID
% values in fonts, create an entry into the /FontUIDBlackList dictionary
% defined below.
%
% It does not matter what value is associated to the UID key. The values are
% not currently used.
%
% The dictionary keys must be integers - not names with digit characters.
