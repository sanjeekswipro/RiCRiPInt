_Release Notes_

The Release notes cover technical aspects of the RIP, including installation and any late breaking technical news. As such, it should be considered the first point of reference with respect for any technical issues and also, to supersede any information supplied elsewhere in any other documentation. The information in the release notes is always the most up to date source.

_Host Renderer SDK Document Library help_

Part of the Harlequin Host Renderer SDK.

See \doc\HqnRIP_SDK_Document_Library.chm. This contains the XPS RIP SDK : XPSDrv Help (which includes the documentation on the XPSDrv filter integration), the Harlequin RIP SDK Getting Started guide, the Harlequin RIP Programmer’s Reference Manual and the Application Interface documentation. The file is in a fully indexed and searchable help file format. The XPSDrv Help section provides information on; XPS Documents, how they are generated and used; the XPS RIP, the SDK, and how to modify, recompile and deploy the XPSDrv driver. Also included is information on what is supplied and how to use it together with details on filter pipeline integration. The contents of Harlequin RIP SDK Getting started guide and the SDK Programmer’s Reference Manual are described below.

_Harlequin RIP SDK Getting started guide_

Part of the Harlequin Host Renderer SDK and Harlequin Embedded RIP SDK.

See doc\HqnRIP_SDK_GetStarted.pdf. This covers a minimal platform specific skin around the core RIP and describes the API that the skin provides. The skin is supplied as source code as an example implementation that uses the core RIP. (Note that this document is optional and may not be supplied in all distributions.) The content of this document is also included the HqnRIP_SDK_Document_Library.chm help file (described above).

_Harlequin RIP SDK Programmer’s Reference Manual_

Part of the Harlequin Host Renderer SDK and Harlequin Embedded RIP
SDK.

See doc\HqnRIP_SDK_ProgRef.pdf. This provides more in-depth information about the interfaces between the Harlequin core RIP and the platform- and product-dependent skin surrounding it. (Note that this document is optional and may not be supplied in all distributions.)The content of this document is also included the HqnRIP_SDK_Document_Library.chm help file (described above).

_Harlequin RIP SDK Interface and Sample Code Documentation_

Part of the Harlequin Host Renderer SDK and Harlequin Embedded RIP SDK.

See \doc\hqnripsdk-html\HqnRIP_SDK_InterfaceRef.chm. This online help reference documentation provides information on the Harlequin RIP SDK core RIP interface, and the Skinkit and Skintest files that is automatically generated from the source files. This file also provides information on the simplified API (refapi.h), the implementation of the input and output devices tied to the XPSDrv filter pipeline interfaces, and the implementation of the basic XPSDrv filter contract.

_Harlequin RIP SDK Extensions Manual_

Part of the Harlequin Host Renderer SDK, Harlequin Embedded RIP SDK and Harlequin RIP.

See doc\HqnRIP_SDK_Extens.pdf. This provides information about extensions that have been made to the PostScript language, PDF and XPS Document formats. This document covers extended configuration options and is very useful. It is advised that this document is consulted before raising any queries with Global Graphics. (Note that this document is optional and may not be supplied in all distributions.)
