% This file is used to define default font and font substitution preferences.
%
% It is supplemented by the Font Substitution Database defined in the file
% /SW/Config/FontSubstitutionDB. That file is not user-editable, but any
% undesired substitution in that file can be overridden in this file, by
% substituting with the desired font, or even with itself, eg:
%
%   /SomeFontName /SomeFontName

% NOTE:
% You can cut and paste font names from the RIP window, so if a font is reported
% as missing, you can copy the name from the report and paste it in here. You
% can usually identify fonts by a name, /Courier, or a string, (Courier),
% interchangeably. However, some PDF files refer to fonts using names that can
% ONLY be defined in string form - in parenthesis - see CIDFontSubstitution
% below for an example.

% ================================ DEFAULT FONT ================================
% Uncomment this (and change the name /Courier) for your favourite font to be
% defaulted.

% $error /SubstituteFont { pop /Courier } bind put                        % <===

% NOTE: This line also appears, commented out, in HqnStart.
% You should normally change this file and not HqnStart.


% ============================== DEFAULT CID FONT ==============================

% Uncomment this (and change the name /CID-Bullet) for your favourite font to be
% defaulted.

% $error /SubstituteCIDFont { pop /CID-Bullet } bind put                  % <===


% ============================== FONT SUBSTITUTION =============================

statusdict /FontSubstitution <<
% Add entries in this section to have the RIP silently respond all requests for
% one font by using another.
%
% Each line should comprise of two font names, the fonts to be substituted from
% and to.
%
% E.g. if you wanted all requests for Arial to be imaged in Helvetica you would
% enter:
%           /Arial  /Helvetica
%
% NOTES: You MUST ensure that:
% a) the two fonts are very similar in glyphs supported and glyph names,
%    otherwise a lot of glyphs may be missing, or replaced with plain rectangles
%    on the output.
% b) single-byte fonts should not be used to substitute for double-byte fonts
%    and vice versa.
% c) when substituting for double-byte fonts the two two fonts should use the
%    same encoding.
% d) do not include CID fonts here - they should be in the next section. You
%    cannot use this mechanism to substitute a none-CID font for a CID font or
%    vice versa

% ENTER NAMES HERE                                                        % <===

% ============================ CID FONT SUBSTITUTION ===========================

statusdict /CIDFontSubstitution <<
% Add entries in this section to have the RIP silently respond all requests for
% one CID font by using another.
%
% Each line should comprise of two names, the CID fonts to be substituted from
% and to.
%
% E.g. if you wanted all requests for Ryumin-Light to be imaged in RodinCID_DB
% you would enter:
%           /Ryumin-Light   /RodinCID_DB
%
% NOTES: You MUST ensure that:
% a) the two fonts have the same Registry and Ordering entries. That means that
%    they would ordinarily use the same CMaps.
% b) the two fonts are of the same CIDFontType.
% c) If the font name contains any international characters (bytes > 126), you
%    must enclose it in parentheses, prefixing any parenthesis or backslash
%    characters with a backslash.
%    E.g. if the RIP says "Cannot find CIDFont |Ç|b(\Ÿ," write:
%           (|Ç|b\(\\Ÿ)   /SquareGothicBT

% ======================== CONDITIONAL FONT SUBSTITUION ========================

% By default, when a conditional font substitution is done, a message is
% output on the monitor. By un-commenting the following line, defining
% /SilentCondFontSub as true, no such messages are displayed.  This
% applies to both standard and CID font substitutions.

statusdict /ConditionalFontSubstitution <<
% As for the Font Substitution dictionary above, but substitutions entered
% will only be made if the original font can not be found.  Note that if an
% unconditional font substitution was made (via the dictionary above), and
% if that substituted font was not found, it may still be offered for
% conditional substitition through this dictionary.
% In the following dictionary, each key's value is an array of possible
% substitutions.  Each font name in the array is tried in the order
% stated.  Examples are provided but left commented-out.
