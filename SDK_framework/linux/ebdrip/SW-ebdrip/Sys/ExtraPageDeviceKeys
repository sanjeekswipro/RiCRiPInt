% This file should produce a set of key / value pairs on the operand stack to
% be used as extensions for setpagedevice, typically either for use as
% additonal medai selection keys (in which case you will also need to modify
% Sys/ExtraMediaSelectionKeys) or as pagebuffer device parameters (for which
% you need to refer to OEM documentation for detail).
% For example:
%                 /MyMediaKey         null
%                 /MyPageBufferOption /Red
%
/PageBufferType /GGE
/EndRender                             % PS to tell RIP to notify page rendering completion to embedded device
   << /zzEmbeddedNotifyEndRender       % starts with zz to allow other EndRender hooks to execute first (alphabetically)
   {
     (%embedded%) << /EndRender true >> setdevparams      % set EndRender flag in embedded device to trigger page checkin
   } bind
   >>

% PageBufferGeneration is used as a hook to note when all pagebuffer changes
