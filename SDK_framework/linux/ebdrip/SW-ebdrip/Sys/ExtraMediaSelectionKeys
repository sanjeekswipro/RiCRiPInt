% This file should produce a set (possibly none) of key / value pairs
% on the operand stack to be used as additional media selection keys 
% (as per the note on page 243 of Red Book 2). The values are always either
% /InputAttributes or /OutputAttributes. The keys must also be keys for 
% setpagedevice so will also need including in Sys/ExtraPageDeviceKeys.
% See OEM documentation for detail.
% For example:
%                 /MyMediaKey /InputAttributes
